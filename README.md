### Eat Da Burger

Create custom dishes, eat them up, and view both the eaten and uneaten dishes. Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). 

    * Eat Da Burger is a restaurant app that allows users to input the name of the dish that they would like to eat.

    * Whenever a user submits the name of a dish, the app will display the dish on the left side of the page.

    * Click the 'EAT' button to devour the food!

    * The dish name will populate on the right after the 'EAT' button is clicked.

    * Each pre-designed dish is ready for the user to eat.

    * The app stores every dish in the database, whether devoured or not.
